# Constructor-Word-Guess

This is a terminal application in which the user can try and guess, hangman style, the 150 original pokemon.

# Motivation

Learning to code with constructors is what pushed me to put myself through this.

# Code Example

This is some code I used after the inquirer prompt, so when the user enters a letter.
